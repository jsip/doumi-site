You can connect Netlify CMS to your [local git repo](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#working-with-a-local-git-repository) (currenly a beta feature) by running this command in a separate terminal.

```
$ npx netlify-cms-proxy-server

The Netlify CMS Admin will then be available at `localhost:8000/admin`.
